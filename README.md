Calculator Version 0.02
This project is an upgraded calculator that evaluates mathematical expressions, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus operations. It has been developed to handle various mathematical expressions while maintaining proper operator precedence and brackets.

Features
Evaluates expressions with:
Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication (*)
Division (/)
Modulus (%)
Supports brackets for grouping expressions.
Handles negative numbers using brackets.
Known Issues
Currently, there is a limitation in handling subtraction operations. Users must input subtraction using brackets and a negative sign. For example:

Instead of writing 10 - 2, you must write 10 + (-2) or 10 * (-2).
This issue will be addressed in future updates to complete this version of the calculator.

Development History
This is version 0.02 of the calculator. I previously created a simpler version, 0.01, but I took a long break to complete this upgrade. During the development process, I utilized AI to help write comments and fix a few bugs. However, the core idea and the majority of the work have been done by myself.

Usage
To use the calculator, simply enter a mathematical expression when prompted. The program will evaluate the expression and display the result.

Example
Enter the expression: 10 + (-2)
The result of the expression is: 8.00

Conclusion
I will continue to work on this project to enhance its functionality and address the known issues. Your feedback and contributions are welcome!
