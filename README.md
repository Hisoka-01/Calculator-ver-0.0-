# Calculator-ver-0.0-
This is my first project. I am making a calculator in C .<br/>
Made the first code to calculate basic mathematical operations.<br/>
Made a code to take the input in a single line (unlinke in previous code where it took input in different line ) and do mathematical operation. <br/>
Started working on solving equation by using BODMAS.<br/>
Completed writing a code to accept input as string and seperate into two diff arrays to store values and signs.
